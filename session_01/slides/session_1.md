# Naming Python Files

- Lowercase
- Underscore instead of spaces
- No punctuation

---

# Hello, world!

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

# Variables

---

# Variables

```python
<variable_name> = <value>
```

---

# Variables

```python
name = "Charlie"
age = 27
left_to_pay = 29.99
has_paid = False
```

---

# Variables

- Any mix of letters, numbers and some special characters
- Must start with a letter
- Keep lowercase
- Use underscore where there are spaces

---

# Writing Python

- You are not writing an essay...
- Keep things lowercase
- Don't use punctuation
- Replace spaces with underscores

---

# Data Types
